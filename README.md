# tic-tac-toe

Goal: Build an automated tic-tac-toe player which learns via machine learning and is capable of playing on websites

Purpose: Learning on selenium, OCR, and ML


	Steps:
  	1. Build automated tic-tac-toe player for a single site without ML
    	- This will use python and selenium to perform actions on the site
    	- Understanding the current context (e.g. what cards you have) will be done via reading the 
			HTML Canvas element as an image file, then performing OCR on it
		- Decision engine will just be hardcoded, no ML at this point
  	2. Change decision engine from hardcoded rules to ML
		- TensorFlow will be used. Further details TBD.
